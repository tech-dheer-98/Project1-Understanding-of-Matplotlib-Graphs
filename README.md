# Project Title: Exploring Data Visualization with Matplotlib

In this project, we dive into the world of data visualization using the Matplotlib library in Python. We explore various types of graphs and charts, understanding the basic parameters used to customize and enhance them. Each graph is accompanied by visual insights to help understand the data better.

## Topics Covered:
- Bar Graph
- Line Plot Graph
- Pie Chart Graph
- Box Plot Graph
- Histogram Graph
- Violin Plot Graph
- Stem Plot Graph
- Stack Plot Graph
- Step Plot Graph
- Scatter Plot Graph
- Subplots and Savefig

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/tech-dheer-98).

## Libraries Used:
- Matplotlib (for plotting graphs)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to visualize data effectively using Matplotlib and be able to create insightful visualizations for your own datasets.
